          Hey there! Iâ€™m Cristian Sbardelotto, a FullStack Developer.
        </p>

        <p className='mt-4 lg:text-xl lg:leading-relaxed'>
          I kicked off my web programming journey back in August 2022 and my
          current goal is to land my first job and eventually become a Tech Lead
          down the road.
        </p>

        <p className='mt-4 lg:text-xl lg:leading-relaxed'>
          By now, my go-to tech stack includes Javascript, Typescript, React,
          NextJS, NodeJS, Prisma, Fastify.
        </p>

        <p className='mt-4 lg:text-xl lg:leading-relaxed'>
          As a young programmer, I got some &quot;<i>default</i> &quot; hobbies,
          such as playing videogames (you can check out some of them on the
          Games App, on Start Menu), listen to a lot of music, especially Eminem
          (you can also see some of your most listened tracks on the Tracks
          App), playing some football, and of course, programming.
        </p>
