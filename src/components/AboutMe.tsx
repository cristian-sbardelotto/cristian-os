        <p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Cristian Sbardelotto, a FullStack Developer.</p>

        <p className='mt-4'>
          I kicked off my web programming journey back in August 2022 and my
          current goal is to land my first job and eventually become a Tech Lead
          down the road.
        </p>

        <p className='mt-4'>
          By now, my go-to tech stack includes Javascript, Typescript, React,
          NextJS, NodeJS, Prisma, Fastify.
        </p>

        <p className='mt-4'>
          As a young programmer, I got some &quot;default&quot; hobbies, such as
          playing videogames (you can check out some of them on the Games App,
          on Start Menu), listen to a lot of music, especially Eminem (you can
          also see some of them on the Songs App), playing some football, and of
          course, programming.
        </p>

        <p className='mt-4'>
          Wanna chat about tech, games, or sports? Shoot me a message!
